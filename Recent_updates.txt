## Deal Holds & Booking Availability - Feb 1, 2026 (11:15pm)

### 5-Minute Deal Holds
- When user enters booking page, deal is held for 5 minutes
- Other users cannot book or see held deals
- Hold is released when user leaves page or completes booking
- Prevents double-booking scenarios

### Booked Deals Hidden from Listings
- Confirmed bookings are filtered out of deal listings
- Users won't see deals that have already been booked
- File: `server/storage.ts` - getDeals() filters booked deals
- File: `server/routes.ts` - Also filters held deals

### New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/deals/:dealId/hold` - Create 5-min hold
- `DELETE /api/deals/:dealId/hold` - Release hold
- `GET /api/deals/:dealId/availability` - Check if available

## Stripe Payment & UI Fixes - Feb 1, 2026 (10:40pm)

### Payment Flow - FIXED (CRITICAL)
- **Root cause**: Nested forms - StripePaymentForm had `<form>` inside Booking's `<Form>`
- **Fix**: Changed StripePaymentForm from `<form>` to `<div>`, button from `type="submit"` to `type="button"` with `onClick`
- File: `client/src/components/StripePaymentForm.tsx`
- Uses `stripe.confirmCardPayment()` with CardElement (no redirects)
- Auto-submits booking after successful payment
- Payment → Booking confirmation is now seamless

### Rate Limiting Fix for Payment Intent
- File: `server/rate-limit.ts`
- Added separate `paymentRateLimit` (30 requests/hour)
- Prevents blocking during payment testing
- File: `server/routes.ts` - Updated to use new limiter

### Stripe Payment Form Fix
- File: `client/src/components/StripePaymentForm.tsx`
- Fixed multiple API calls on re-renders using useRef
- Payment intent only created once when guest details complete
- Added waiting state before guest details are filled

### Force Light Mode
- File: `client/src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- Forced light mode for better visual appearance
- Disabled theme toggle functionality
