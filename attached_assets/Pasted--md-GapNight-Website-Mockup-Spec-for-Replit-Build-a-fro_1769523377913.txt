# GapNight — Website Mockup Spec (for Replit)

> Build a **front-end mockup** website for a concept called **GapNight** (name can be swapped easily).
> The product sells **hotel “gap nights / orphan nights”** (usually 1-night stays, sometimes 2) at clearance prices.
> The UI should feel like the flight-deals app screenshot: **big search bar at top**, **category chips**, **filter chips**, and a **scrolling list of deal cards**.

---

## 1) Concept Summary (what GapNight is)

**GapNight** is a hotel deals marketplace that focuses **only** on nights hotels struggle to sell:
- **Gap nights / orphan nights** (awkward 1-night holes between bookings)
- **Last-minute empty nights** (within a short window, e.g., the next 7 days)

Hotels list:
- the room type, the available dates, and the price they’re willing to take
- the “normal” public price (to show how good the deal is)
- rules (refund policy, check-in window, min/max nights, etc.)

Users browse like this:
- They **don’t need to choose an exact date**.
- They enter a location (can be **city / region / country**).
- The site returns the **best deals** in a rolling window (e.g., **next 7 days**) as 1-night stays.

**Core promise to users:**
> “Hotels’ unsold gap nights at clearance prices.”

**Core promise to hotels:**
> “We only sell your distressed nights. You keep control of price, nights, and inventory.”

## 2) MVP Rules (for the mockup)

We’re simulating an MVP launch with simple constraints:
- Default search window: **Next 7 days**
- Default duration: **1 night** (with optional toggle for 2 nights later)
- Deals displayed should show:
  - **Hotel name**
  - **Star rating**
  - **Dates** (e.g., “Tue 12 Mar → Wed 13 Mar”)
  - **Price** (big)
  - **Normal price** (crossed out)
  - **% discount** badge (calculated)
  - **Photo** thumbnail on the left

This is only a mockup:
- No real booking engine
- No payments
- No hotel onboarding portal (just a “List your hotel” CTA with a placeholder form)

## 3) Design Goals (match the screenshot vibe)

### Visual Style
- Clean, modern, mobile-first
- Light background
- Rounded cards
- “Chip” style tabs and filters
- Bold price typography
- Optional “Deal score” style badge (like the screenshot’s “AI deal score”)

### Layout (in order, top to bottom)
1. **Top Search Bar**
   - Left: search icon
   - Main text: `Melbourne (VIC) ↔ Anywhere` style (for hotels it can be `Melbourne → Anywhere`)
   - Subtext: `Anytime • 1 guest • 1 night (Gap Nights)`
   - Right: dropdown arrow icon

2. **Category Chips Row**
   - Examples:
     - All Deals
     - Last Minute
     - Trending
     - Beach
     - City
     - Luxury (optional)
   - Selecting a category filters/sorts the list (mock behavior)

3. **Filter Chips Row**
   - Examples:
     - All filters
     - Price
     - Rating
     - Distance
     - Dates (or “Next 7 days”)
     - Duration (1 night)
     - Free cancellation (optional; likely rare in gap-night inventory)

4. **Section Header**
   - Left: `Explore today’s deals`
   - Right: Sort dropdown: `Best (highest deal score)` / `Cheapest` / `Biggest discount` / `Highest rating`

5. **Deals List**
   - Scroll list of deal cards
   - Each card:
     - left thumbnail image
     - hotel name, location
     - date line
     - rating + stars
     - deal badge (discount % or “Deal score”)
     - crossed out normal price and bold price
     - chevron arrow on right to open detail view
     - optional bell icon to “watch” (mock)

## 4) Pages to Build

### A) Home / Deals (Primary)
Route: `/`
- Contains the full UI described above
- Includes a static list of mock deals (JSON)
- Search input updates the heading and filters the list (simple string match is fine)

### B) Deal Detail (Secondary)
Route: `/deal/:id`
- Shows:
  - big hero image
  - hotel name + stars
  - deal price + normal price + discount %
  - dates, room type
  - “Why this is cheap” text:
    - “This is a gap night the hotel is trying to fill.”
  - simple “Request booking” button (does nothing or opens modal)
  - amenities list (mock)
  - cancellation policy badge (mock)

### C) List Your Hotel (Simple Form)
Route: `/list-your-hotel`
- A simple form mock:
  - Hotel name
  - City
  - Contact email
  - “How many gap nights per week?” (dropdown)
  - Submit button → shows success message (no backend)

### D) Join Waitlist (Simple Form)
Route: `/waitlist`
- Email + preferred city
- Submit → success toast

---

## 5) Deal Card Content Requirements

Each deal card should include:

- **Hotel Name**
- **Location** (country/state optional)
- **Dates** (check-in → check-out)
- **Star Rating** (e.g., 4.5 + 4–5 star icons)
- **Deal Badge**
  - Either:
    - `XX% off` OR
    - `Deal score: 90` (like the screenshot vibe)
- **Normal Price** (crossed out)
- **Discounted Price** (bold, large)
- **Photo thumbnail** on left
- Right chevron icon
- Optional bell icon (watchlist)

## 6) Mock Data (use this JSON shape)

Create mock data locally inside the project (no DB).

### Deal object shape
```json
{
  "id": "gn_001",
  "hotelName": "Crown City Suites",
  "location": "Melbourne, Australia",
  "stars": 5,
  "rating": 4.6,
  "reviewCount": 1284,
  "checkInDate": "2026-02-14",
  "checkOutDate": "2026-02-15",
  "nights": 1,
  "roomType": "King Room",
  "imageUrl": "/images/hotel-1.jpg",
  "normalPrice": 420,
  "dealPrice": 189,
  "currency": "A$",
  "dealScore": 92,
  "categoryTags": ["All Deals", "Last Minute", "City"],
  "cancellation": "Non-refundable",
  "whyCheap": "Gap night: 1-night orphan slot between longer bookings."
}
````

### Calculations (front-end)

* `discountPercent = round((normalPrice - dealPrice) / normalPrice * 100)`
* Optionally show:

  * `Save A$X`

---

## 7) Suggested Copy (use these exact phrases)

### Top headline area

* Title: `Explore today’s deals`
* Subtitle under search bar:

  * `Anytime • 1 guest • 1 night (Gap Nights)`

### What is GapNight? (optional footer or small info section)

* `GapNight shows discounted 1-night stays that hotels usually struggle to fill — “gap nights” between bookings and last-minute empty rooms.`

### Card badge examples

* `90% deal score`
* `42% off`
* `Gap night deal`

### Deal detail explanation

* `Why is this so cheap?`
* `This hotel has a 1-night gap between bookings. Instead of leaving it empty, they list it on GapNight at a clearance rate.`

---

## 8) Interactions (mock behavior)

### Search

* User types a location:

  * Filter list where `location` includes the query OR
  * If query is blank, show all deals

### Category chips

* Clicking a category filters deals by `categoryTags`

### Sort

* Dropdown options:

  * Best (highest dealScore)
  * Cheapest (lowest dealPrice)
  * Biggest discount (highest discountPercent)
  * Highest rating

### Watchlist

* Clicking bell toggles “watched”
* Store in local state only

### Deal click

* Clicking card navigates to `/deal/:id`

## 9) Tech & Implementation Notes (Replit-friendly)

**Recommended stack:** Next.js + Tailwind (or React + Vite + Tailwind)

* Mobile-first layout
* Reusable components:

  * `TopSearchBar`
  * `CategoryChips`
  * `FilterChips`
  * `SortDropdown`
  * `DealCard`
  * `DealList`

**No backend required** for the mockup.

**Images:**

* Use placeholder images (local assets or public placeholder URLs)
* Ensure cards look good even if images are generic

---

## 10) UI Component Breakdown (what to build)

### TopSearchBar

* Input styled like the screenshot (large rounded rectangle)
* Main line: `Melbourne (VIC) ↔ Anywhere`
* Sub line: `Anytime • 1 guest • 1 night`

### CategoryChips

* Horizontal scroll on mobile
* Selected chip highlighted

### FilterChips

* Horizontal scroll
* “All filters” chip includes icon

### DealCard

* Card container with:

  * left image (square, rounded)
  * middle content
  * right side price + chevron
* Crossed out normal price smaller, grey
* Deal price bold and large

### DealDetail

* Hero image

---

## 11) What NOT to build (avoid scope creep)

* Payments / Stripe
* Real hotel inventory connections
* Scraping
* Login systems
* Admin dashboards

This mockup is purely for:

* proving the idea visually
* collecting waitlist emails
* showing hotels what the product would look like

---

## 12) Optional Add-ons (nice if quick)

* “Next 7 days” selector (7 / 14 / 30)
* Toggle for `1 night` vs `2 nights`
* “Budget slider” filter
* “Only show 4+ star hotels” filter
* A tiny “How it works” modal

---

## Deliverable Checklist

* [ ] `/` page matches the screenshot vibe (search bar, chips, deal list)
* [ ] Deal cards show: image, name, rating, dates, normal price, deal price, discount badge
* [ ] Sorting + filtering works on mock data
* [ ] `/deal/:id` detail page
* [ ] `/list-your-hotel` simple form
* [ ] `/waitlist` simple form

---

## Name/Brand Placeholder

Use **GapNight** as the placeholder brand in the UI.
Domain candidates discussed include:

* gapnight.com
* sparenight.com
* nitedeal.com

Make the brand name easy to swap by keeping it in one config variable.
