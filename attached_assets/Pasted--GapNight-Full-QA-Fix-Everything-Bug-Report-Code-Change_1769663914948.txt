# GapNight: Full QA + Fix Everything (Bug Report + Code Changes)

You are a senior full-stack engineer + QA.

## Objective
1) Crawl and test the GapNight web app end-to-end.
2) Produce a **comprehensive bug report** (prioritized).
3) Then **fix every issue you listed** directly in the codebase.
4) Provide a clear summary of what changed + how to verify.

## Constraints / Expectations
- Fixes must be committed as real code changes (not just suggestions).
- Do not change the product direction — keep existing layout and features, just make them correct, consistent, and stable.
- Maintain the GapNight brand theme: deep navy + teal accents + soft gradients, rounded cards/buttons, minimal premium feel.
- Ensure the site is fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop).
- Prefer simple, maintainable changes over rewrites.

## Part A — Comprehensive Bug Report
### Testing Requirements
Test all pages/routes:
- Landing page
- Deals list page
- Hotel detail page
- Any owner pages that exist (login/dashboard) even if mocked

Test on:
- Desktop: 1440x900
- Tablet: 768x1024
- Mobile: 390x844 and 320x568
Browsers: Chromium default.

### Report Format
Create a Markdown report named: `BUG_REPORT.md`

Include:
1) Executive summary (1 paragraph)
2) Prioritized list of issues (Blocker/High/Medium/Low)
3) Each issue must include:
   - Title
   - Severity + Priority
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual
   - Root cause hypothesis
   - Proposed fix
4) Include UX/polish issues (spacing, typography, consistency, accessibility).
5) Include performance issues (layout shift, image sizing, slow loads).

## Part B — Fix All Issues
After writing `BUG_REPORT.md`, implement fixes.

### Must-fix categories
- Navigation: broken links, wrong routes, anchor scroll, active states
- Responsive: overflow, misaligned hero, cards wrapping, text clipping
- Visual consistency: colors, typography scale, shadows, border radii, spacing
- Accessibility: focus states, button labels, keyboard navigation, contrast
- Error states: empty deals, missing images, no search result, API failure placeholders
- Performance: optimize images, prevent layout shift, reduce huge assets, avoid re-render loops
- Data formatting: currency formatting, date formatting, percent badges

### Code Quality Requirements
- No console errors/warnings on load
- Remove dead code
- Add small helper utilities where needed (formatPrice, formatDate, classnames)
- Add basic unit tests if project already has test setup; otherwise add minimal runtime checks only

## Part C — Deliverables
1) `BUG_REPORT.md` created/updated.
2) All fixes applied in code.
3) A final summary in the chat:
   - List of fixed issues (by BUG-###)
   - Which files were changed
   - How to verify quickly (a short checklist)
4) If you add any new env vars/config, document them in `README.md`.

## Notes / Current Known Intent
GapNight is a gap-night hotel deals marketplace.
- Users search a location without selecting dates.
- Deals should appear grouped by hotel, and clicking a hotel shows available deal dates.

Now start: audit the running app, write `BUG_REPORT.md`, then fix everything you found.
