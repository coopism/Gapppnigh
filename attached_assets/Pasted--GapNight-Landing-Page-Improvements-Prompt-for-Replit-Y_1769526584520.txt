# GapNight Landing Page Improvements — Prompt for Replit

You are improving an existing GapNight landing page. Use the attached screenshot as the **target hero layout and style** (modern, airy, soft gradient background, rounded UI, teal accents, bold headline).

## Goal
Update the landing page to:
1) Match the **new hero design** shown in the screenshot (layout, typography, spacing, feel).
2) Add a **dictionary/definition-style section** that explains what a “Gap Night” is (to build trust + brand the term).
3) Keep the page conversion-focused with clear CTAs for both consumers and hotels.

## Brand & Product Summary (use this as truth)
GapNight is a hotel deals marketplace that sells **unsold “gap nights”**:
- Usually **1-night openings** between existing bookings.
- Hotels discount these nights because they would otherwise go unused.
- Users can search by **location without selecting exact dates** and see the best deals in a rolling window (default: next 7 days).
- Hotels control pricing, availability, and room count.

---

## 1) Header / Navigation (top bar)
### Layout
- Left: GapNight logo + wordmark
- Middle/right: links
  - Browse Deals
  - For Hotels
- Far right: primary CTA button
  - **Join Waitlist** (pill-shaped, teal background, white text)
- Sticky on scroll (optional)

### Style
- Minimal, white background, subtle border/shadow
- Rounded logo tile (like screenshot)

---

## 2) Hero Section (match screenshot)
### Background
- Soft radial/gradient background with light grey-blue tones.
- Centered hero content with plenty of whitespace.

### Hero content (centered)
1) Small pill badge above headline:
   - Text: **Australia’s #1 Gap Night Marketplace**
   - Icon: sparkle/star (optional)
   - Style: light background, teal text, rounded, subtle shadow

2) Headline (large, bold, two-tone emphasis)
   - Line 1: **Luxury Hotels at**
   - Line 2: **Clearance Prices** (teal highlight)
   - Use big, clean font, strong weight.

3) Subheadline (1–2 lines, readable)
   - Use exactly or close to:
     - `Discover "gap nights" — single-night openings between bookings that hotels sell at up to 70% off. Same room, same service, incredible savings.`

4) Search bar (large, rounded, with icon)
   - Placeholder: **Where do you want to stay?**
   - Left icon: location pin
   - Right: Search button (teal pill) with magnifier icon + label “Search”
   - This search does not require dates; just location text.
   - Mock behavior: updates deal list section below or scrolls to deals.

5) Social proof stats row (3 columns)
   - `15+` Active Deals
   - `50%` Avg. Savings
   - `4.5` Avg. Rating (add small star icon)
   - Use subtle labels, bold numbers.

### Hero CTA logic
- Primary CTA is search.
- Secondary CTAs in hero (optional, smaller):
  - “Browse Deals”
  - “List Your Hotel”

---

## 3) Add NEW “Definition” Section (dictionary-style)
Place directly **below the hero** (or as a left-right split section):

### Visual style
- Minimal dictionary aesthetic, lots of whitespace, serif headline is allowed.
- Looks like a definition card or printed dictionary excerpt.

### Copy (use this structure)
- Title: **Gap Night**
- Pronunciation: `[gap-nahyt]`
- Part of speech: `noun`
- Definition line (keep simple + trustworthy):
  - `A single unsold night between hotel bookings — discounted so it doesn’t go unused.`
- One supporting line:
  - `Hotels list these nights directly on GapNight, so you get real discounts on real rooms.`
- Optional mini bullet list (max 3):
  - `• Usually 1 night`
  - `• Limited rooms`
  - `• Often 20–70% off`

### Microcopy tip
Avoid jargon like “distressed inventory”. Keep it consumer-friendly.

## 4) Deals Preview Section (below definition)
Add a section titled:
- **Explore today’s gap night deals**

Display 6–10 sample deal cards:
- Card includes:
  - left image thumbnail
  - hotel name
  - star rating (e.g., 4.6) + star icons
  - location
  - dates (e.g., “Tue 12 Mar → Wed 13 Mar”)
  - normal price (strikethrough)
  - deal price (bold)
  - badge: `XX% off` or `Deal score 90`
- Card style:
  - rounded corners, subtle shadow, clean spacing
- Sort dropdown (optional):
  - Best / Cheapest / Biggest discount / Highest rating

---

## 5) “How it works” Section (simple, trust-building)
3 steps, icons optional:
1) **Search a location** (no dates needed)
2) **Pick a gap night deal** (1-night openings)
3) **Book for less** (hotel-approved discounts)

Keep short.

---

## 6) “For Hotels” Section (conversion block)
Add a clear section for hotels:
- Headline: **Fill your gap nights without discounting your whole calendar**
- Bullets:
  - Only list nights you want to fill
  - Control price + inventory
  - Reach new last-minute guests
- CTA button: **List Your Hotel**
- This can link to `/list-your-hotel` (mock)

---

## 7) Footer
Include:
- Short description of GapNight
- Links: Browse Deals, For Hotels, Terms, Privacy
- Optional disclaimer:
  - “Discounts vary by property and availability.”

---

## Styling & Implementation Notes
- Build mobile-first; hero should stack nicely.
- Use a modern font (e.g., Inter for body; optional serif for “Gap Night” definition title only).
- Use consistent teal accent color across buttons and highlights.
- No backend required — static mock data is fine.
- Use smooth scroll when clicking “Browse Deals”.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Landing page hero closely matches the screenshot’s look/feel: centered headline, teal emphasis, pill badge, large search bar, stats row.
- Page includes the new dictionary-style “Gap Night” explanation section.
- Deals preview cards look like a premium “deal feed” and include crossed-out normal price + bold discounted price.
- Clear consumer path (search/browse) and hotel path (list your hotel).
